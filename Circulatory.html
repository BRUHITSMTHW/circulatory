    <center><div class="first-div"><h1 class="second-header">Purpose</h1></div></center>
    <div class="first-p"><center><p>The purpose of the circulatory system is to spread oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells in the body, and to remove waste in the form of carbon dioxide. The main components of the circulatory system are the heart and blood vessels.</p></center></div>
    <div><center><h2 class="heart-header">The Heart</h2></center>
    <center><p class="second-p">The heart's job is to send the red blood cells around the body to distribute oxygen and other important minerals and molecules. The heart does this by using muscles to pump the blood through different chambers. Humans have a four-chambered heart, which means there are two entry and exit points. One set of chambers is for blood that is carrying no oxygen, or deoxygenated blood. The heart pumps this blood into the lungs, where the red blood cells pick up oxygen molecules. Then, the blood enters the second set of chambers, where the heart pumps it back out into the body to distribute the oxygen.</p></center>

    <div><center><h2 class="blood-header">The Blood Vessels</h2></center>
    <center><p class="third-p">The blood vessels are a long set of tubes that carry blood throughout the body. There are two types of blood vessels: veins and arteries. Veins are the blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This is so the heart can pump more blood into the lungs to distribute oxygen throughout the body. Without veins, the blood would never be able to carry more oxygen through the body, as it would never reach the heart. Arteries, on the other hand, carry oxygenated blood around the body to distribute oxygen picked up by the red blood cells. Without arteries, oxygen would never reach the cells in our bodies.</p></center>
